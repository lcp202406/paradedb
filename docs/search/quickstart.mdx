This guide will walk you through the following steps to get started with ParadeDB Search:

1. Full text search
2. Similarity (i.e. vector) search
3. Hybrid search

## Full Text Search

ParadeDB comes with a helpful procedure that creates a table populated with mock data to help
you get started. Once connected with `psql`, run the following commands to create and inspect
this table.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25_test_table(
  schema_name => 'public',
  table_name => 'mock_items'
);

SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
       description        | rating |  category
--------------------------+--------+-------------
 Ergonomic metal keyboard |      4 | Electronics
 Plastic Keyboard         |      4 | Electronics
 Sleek running shoes      |      5 | Footwear
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

Next, let's create a BM25 index called `search_idx` on this table. We'll index the
`description` and `category` fields and configure the tokenizer on the `description` field.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25(
        index_name => 'search_idx',
        schema_name => 'public',
        table_name => 'mock_items',
        key_field => 'id',
        text_fields => paradedb.field('description', tokenizer => paradedb.tokenizer('en_stem')) ||
                       paradedb.field('category')
        numeric_fields => paradedb.field('rating')
);
```

<Note>
Note the mandatory `key_field` option. Every BM25 index needs a `key_field`, which should
be the name of a column that will function as a row's unique identifier within the index. Usually, the `key_field`
can just be the name of your table's primary key column.
</Note>

We're now ready to execute a full-text search. We'll look for rows with a `rating` greater than `2` where `description` matches `shoes`
or `category` matches `electronics`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM search_idx.search(
  '(description:keyboard OR category:electronics) AND rating:>2',
  limit_rows => 5
);
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
         description         | rating |  category
-----------------------------+--------+-------------
 Plastic Keyboard            |      4 | Electronics
 Ergonomic metal keyboard    |      4 | Electronics
 Innovative wireless earbuds |      5 | Electronics
 Fast charging power bank    |      4 | Electronics
 Bluetooth-enabled speaker   |      3 | Electronics
(5 rows)
```
</Accordion>

<Note>
Note the usage of `limit_rows` instead of the SQL `LIMIT` clause. For optimal performance, we recommend always using
`limit_rows` and `offset_rows` instead of `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.

Similarly, the `rating` column was indexed and the `rating:>2` filter was used instead of the SQL `WHERE` clause
for [efficient filtering](/search/full-text/bm25#efficient-filtering).
</Note>

Next, let's see how ParadeDB handles a phrase query like `bluetooth speaker`. Let's also surface results even
if there is a word between `bluetooth` and `speaker`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM search_idx.search('description:"bluetooth speaker"~1');
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
        description        | rating |  category
---------------------------+--------+-------------
 Bluetooth-enabled speaker |      3 | Electronics
(1 row)
```
</Accordion>

Note that phrases must be wrapped in double quotes. Also note our use of the `~1` slop operator,
which tells ParadeDB to return matches even if they are separated by `1` word.

Next, let's match against a partial word like `blue`. To
do this, we'll create a new index that uses the `ngrams` tokenizer,
which splits text into chunks of size `n`.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25(
        index_name => 'ngrams_idx',
        schema_name => 'public',
        table_name => 'mock_items',
        key_field => 'id',
        text_fields => paradedb.field('description', tokenizer => paradedb.tokenizer('ngram', min_gram => 4, max_gram => 4, prefix_only => false)) ||
                       paradedb.field('category')
);

SELECT description, rating, category
FROM ngrams_idx.search('description:blue');
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
        description        | rating |  category
---------------------------+--------+-------------
 Bluetooth-enabled speaker |      3 | Electronics
(1 row)
```
</Accordion>

Finally, let's use the `snippet` function to examine the BM25 scores and generate
highlighted snippets for our results.

```sql
SELECT * FROM ngrams_idx.snippet(
  'description:blue',
  highlight_field => 'description'
);
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
 id |             snippet              | score_bm25
----+----------------------------------+------------
 32 | <b>Blue</b>tooth-enabled speaker |  2.9903657
(1 row)
```
</Accordion>

Let's join this result with our `mock_items` table to see the BM25 scores and highlighted snippets
next to the original data:

```sql
WITH snippet AS (
    SELECT * FROM ngrams_idx.snippet(
      'description:blue',
      highlight_field => 'description'
    )
)
SELECT description, snippet, score_bm25
FROM snippet
LEFT JOIN mock_items ON snippet.id = mock_items.id;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
        description        |             snippet              | score_bm25
---------------------------+----------------------------------+------------
 Bluetooth-enabled speaker | <b>Blue</b>tooth-enabled speaker |  2.9903657
(1 row)
```
</Accordion>

Please refer to our [advanced search queries](/search/full-text/complex) guide for all available
query types.

## Similarity Search

For vector similarity search, let's first generate a vector embeddings column. For the sake of this tutorial, we'll
randomly generate these embeddings.

```sql
ALTER TABLE mock_items ADD COLUMN embedding vector(3);

UPDATE mock_items m
SET embedding = ('[' ||
    ((m.id + 1) % 10 + 1)::integer || ',' ||
    ((m.id + 2) % 10 + 1)::integer || ',' ||
    ((m.id + 3) % 10 + 1)::integer || ']')::vector;

SELECT description, rating, category, embedding
FROM mock_items
LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
       description        | rating |  category   | embedding
--------------------------+--------+-------------+-----------
 Ergonomic metal keyboard |      4 | Electronics | [3,4,5]
 Plastic Keyboard         |      4 | Electronics | [4,5,6]
 Sleek running shoes      |      5 | Footwear    | [5,6,7]
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

Next, let's create an HNSW index on the `embedding` column of our table.
While not required, an HNSW index can drastically improve query performance over very large datasets.

```sql
CREATE INDEX on mock_items
USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops);
```

Next, let's query our table with a vector and order the results by L2 distance:

```sql
SELECT description, category, rating, embedding
FROM mock_items
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[1,2,3]'
LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
       description       |  category  | rating | embedding
-------------------------+------------+--------+-----------
 Artistic ceramic vase   | Home Decor |      4 | [1,2,3]
 Modern wall clock       | Home Decor |      4 | [1,2,3]
 Designer wall paintings | Home Decor |      5 | [1,2,3]
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

## Hybrid Search

Finally, let's implement hybrid search, which combines BM25-based full text scores with vector-based
similarity scores. Hybrid search is especially useful in scenarios where you want to match by both
exact keywords and semantic meaning.

The `score_hybrid` function accepts a BM25 query and a similarity query. It applies minmax normalization to the BM25 and
similarity scores and combines them using a weighted average.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.score_hybrid(
    bm25_query => 'description:keyboard OR category:electronics',
    similarity_query => '''[1,2,3]'' <-> embedding',
    bm25_weight => 0.9,
    similarity_weight => 0.1
) LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
 id | score_hybrid
----+--------------
  2 |  0.95714283
  1 |   0.8487012
 29 |         0.1
 39 |         0.1
  9 |         0.1
(5 rows)
```
</Accordion>

Let's join this result with our `mock_items` table to see the full results of our hybrid search:

```sql
SELECT m.description, m.category, m.embedding, s.score_hybrid
FROM mock_items m
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT * FROM search_idx.score_hybrid(
        bm25_query => 'description:keyboard OR category:electronics',
        similarity_query => '''[1,2,3]'' <-> embedding',
        bm25_weight => 0.9,
        similarity_weight => 0.1
    )
) s
ON m.id = s.id
LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
       description        |  category   | embedding | score_hybrid
--------------------------+-------------+-----------+--------------
 Plastic Keyboard         | Electronics | [4,5,6]   |  0.95714283
 Ergonomic metal keyboard | Electronics | [3,4,5]   |   0.8487012
 Designer wall paintings  | Home Decor  | [1,2,3]   |         0.1
 Handcrafted wooden frame | Home Decor  | [1,2,3]   |         0.1
 Modern wall clock        | Home Decor  | [1,2,3]   |         0.1
(5 rows)
```
</Accordion>

As we can see, results with the word `keyboard` scored higher than results with an embedding of
`[1,2,3]` because we placed a weight of `0.9` on the BM25 scores.

<Note>
  Minmax normalization transforms the lowest and highest scores in a dataset to
  `0` and `1`, respectively. Because of this, the lowest-ranking BM25 or
  similarity score may be overlooked, as it is transformed to `0`.
